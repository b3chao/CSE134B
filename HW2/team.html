			<h2>Our Project: A Food Tracking Application</h3>
			<p>Our applicaiton will allow you to search from a database of food items in order to create lists of your favorite foods, grocery shopping lists, and weekly meal plans.
			<p>Users will be able to track the macronutrients of each meal or a combination of meals. Grocery shopping lists are also customized to each meal plan so that the user will know exactly how much ingredients are needed.
			<p>Using the Nutritionix API, our application can provide an extensive selection of meals to choose from to create innovative and better meal plans.
